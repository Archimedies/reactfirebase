About

The purpose of this app is to serve as a on-the-go tool for the roaming artist, allowing creative individuals to quickly sketch out ideas and turn them into templates for later.

** UPDATE FOR FIREBASE ** 
The inclusion of firebase is kind of a mock-up for a feature that eventually would be implemented upon creation where the user can create a file and store data off on firebase, then update or delete later. This would probably also be accomplished with firestore, but I had issues and eventually gave up on fetching images.

Installation/Instructions 

 1. Clone repository to your computer
 2. Navigate inside the created folder in the CLI and execute 'npm install' without quotes to install dependancies.
 3. Execute 'expo start' in the CLI to run the application once dependencies install.
